## What is cascading
Cascading means that the browser decides which CSS rule to apply when multiple rules target the same element.

## CSS Ruleset
A ruleset includes a selector and declaration block with properties and values.

## How selectors work
Selectors target HTML elements to apply styles. Use ID, class, and element selectors. Avoid universal selector for performance. DRY means Don't Repeat Yourself. `!important` overrides everything but should be avoided.

## Colors and Tools
Colors can be defined in HEX, RGB, HSL. VS Code helps select colors. Contrast is important for accessibility. Use Coolors.co for contrast checking.

## Values and Units
CSS uses px, em, rem, %, vw, vh, etc. Know which to use where.

## vw and vh
vw = viewport width, vh = viewport height. They help in responsive design.

## Intro to Box Model
Box model includes content, padding, border, and margin. DevTools can help inspect it.

## Long hand for margin
Margin can be written separately (top, right, bottom, left) or in shorthand.

## Padding and Border Notation
Padding and borders follow same rules for shorthand and longhand.

## Border Radius to Create Circle
Using equal width and height + border-radius: 50% makes a perfect circle.
